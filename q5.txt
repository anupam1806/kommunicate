I would like to work with Anchal Porwal and Rishav Kabra as a partner because earlier we had worked on many projects related to course, hackathon, and group projects. We had a good understanding and and management for a smooth workflow and completion of project before the deadline and a quality best of our knowledge. Best thing we all have different tech-stack specilization to  work on a project and can help each other in any huddles regarding the project.
